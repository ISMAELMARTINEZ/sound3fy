# Project Goals

Add a sound meaning to your d3 graphs to help vision impaired people.

The idea is to:

* Be able to hear the d3 data for 2d graphs. As a start we will use the theremin to represent those.
* Indicate meaning and initial state for the user to be able to determine what each thing means.
* Be able to determine sounds mean, passing from theremin to another representation (for example volume)
*  Be able to determine how to “read” the graph.
*  What happens with dynamic changes? Stop them while reading… but indicate with some tone that something has changed.
